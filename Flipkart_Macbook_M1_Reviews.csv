21,Vivek Rawat,3,Just okay,"No doubt, the laptop is very good. But this 3 star is only for the apple company itself. There is no USB port or card reader port. You will just get 2 type C port and eventually you have to shed extra 6-8k to buy a good quality dock(connector) for this laptop so that you can connect your hard drives, iphone or card reader, etc. Also, even to get a 512GB variant you have to pay a whooping 20k extra. This is insane. Instead of buying 512Gb variant I would suggest to buy a external SSD. I didn‚Äôt...READ MORE"

36,Venkatesh Hariharan,5,Best buy at this point in time (October 2021),"I bought the Apple Macbook Air M1 after extensive research. The x86 processors seem to have fallen far behind in performance and battery life, and is also a very confusing lineup with i3, i5, i7 processors. I am buying a device that should last me for around five years at least so my selection parameters were  (1) Good processor (2) Good battery life and portability (3) Solid build quality.

63,Vandith Sreenivas,5,Fabulous!,"So, this is my first experience with a MacBook. In the past the MacBook Air was considered an underperforming notebook for a very high price. But now because of the m1 chip the performance is incredible for all the apps that can be run on the relatively new platform. Only thing is if you need more RAM or storage, pls upgrade before buying because all parts are soldered into the motherboard so you cannot upgrade it in the future. For me 8gb ram and 256 go ssd is more than enoughREAD MORE"

75,Abhishek Kumar,5,Great product,This is my first mac os laptop. My main purpose to buy this base model air is for picture and video editing. I love the way this small light laptop handles the editing software.
